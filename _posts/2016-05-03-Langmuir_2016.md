We measure the crystallization kinetics of petrolatum-hexadecane emulsion droplets as they are produced in a microfluidic device. After droplets form, they are cooled, causing an interior network of wax crystallites to grow. Polarized light microscopy is used to quantify the droplet crystallinity as a function of residence time in the device. Two wavelengths and two polarization orientations are used to decouple the wavelength dependence of the optical retardation, the crystallite orientation, and the crystallite number density. The droplet crystallinity follows the Avrami kinetic model with parameter values in agreement with the theoretically expected values. These results provide a means to engineer the crystallization kinetics, stability, and arrested coalescence of partially crystalline emulsion droplets.
